Project Description:

This project aims to develop an image loader for Android applications without relying on third-party image loading libraries. The image loader utilizes both memory and disk caching mechanisms to efficiently manage and display images within the application.

Features:

Custom Image Loading: The image loader implements a custom solution for loading images from remote sources without the need for third-party libraries.

Memory Cache: Images are cached in memory to optimize performance and reduce the need for repeated network requests. This helps in faster loading times and smoother user experience, especially when displaying images in lists or grids.

Disk Cache: Images are also cached on disk to persistently store them even after the application is closed. This helps in reducing data usage and loading times by retrieving images locally when available.

Compiled Android studio version : Android Studio Iguana | 2023.2.1 Patch 2
